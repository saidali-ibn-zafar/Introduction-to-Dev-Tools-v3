## watch

- The **"Watch"** feature is used to monitor specific expressions or variables that you choose.

## scope

- The **"Scope"** pane, on the other hand, automatically displays all the variables that are accessible in the current execution context.

## Practical Use

While debugging:

- Use the **Watch** feature when you know exactly which variables or expressions are critical to your current debugging task and you want to monitor their values closely.

- Use the **Scope** feature to get a broader overview of the available data at the current breakpoint, which can help you understand the context of the issue you're investigating.

Both tools are crucial for effective debugging, offering different levels of insight according to your needs at the moment.
