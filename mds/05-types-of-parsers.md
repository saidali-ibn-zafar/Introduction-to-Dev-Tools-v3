## Types of Parsers

There are two types of parsers: **top down** parsers and **bottom up** parsers.

### Top down parsers:

- **Starts from the highest level rule:** Top-down parsers begin parsing from the highest level of the syntax tree and work their way down.

### Bottom-Up Parsers (Shift-Reduce Parsers):

- **Starts from input:** Bottom-up parsers begin with the input and work their way up, gradually transforming it into higher-level syntax rules.

**_Overall, the key difference lies in their approach to parsing: top-down parsers start with the high-level structure and work downwards, while bottom-up parsers start with the input and build upwards towards the high-level structure._**
