### "Optimizing Chrome DevTools Usage: When to Use Incognito Mode and Disable Extensions"?

When using **Chrome Developer Tools**, we should consider using **Incognito mode** or **disabling extensions** if:

- `Extensions might interfere` with the behavior or performance of our webpage.
- `We need a clean environment` to debug issues without external modifications or cached data.

**Incognito** mode is particularly useful because it automatically disables most extensions and avoids using cached data, providing a clearer environment for accurate testing and debugging.
